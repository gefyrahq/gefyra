## Global structure

Docus v4 is a **Nuxt layer** that extends your standard Nuxt application with documentation features. This gives you the flexibility of a full Nuxt project.

When you create a new Docus project with `npx create-docus my-docs`, you get:

```
my-docs/
├── content/             # Your markdown content
│   ├── index.md         # Homepage
│   └── docs/            # Documentation pages
├── public/              # Static assets
└── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
```

You can still use any feature or file of a classical Nuxt project:

```
my-docs/
├── app.config.ts        # App configuration
├── nuxt.config.ts       # Nuxt configuration (add extra modules, components, etc.)
├── app/                 # App directory
│   ├── components/      # Components (add your own components)
│   ├── layouts/         # Layouts (add your own layouts)
│   └── pages/           # Pages (add your own pages)
└── server/              # Server-side code (add your own server-side code)
```



### `content/` directory

This is where you [write pages](/en/concepts/edition) in Markdown. Docus automatically generates routes based on your file structure.

**Single language structure:**
```
content/
├── index.md
├── getting-started.md
└── guide/
    ├── introduction.md
    └── configuration.md
```

**Multi-language structure (with i18n):**
```
content/
├── en/
│   ├── index.md
│   └── guide/
│       └── introduction.md
└── fr/
    ├── index.md
    └── guide/
        └── introduction.md
```

More information about i18n is available in the [Internationalization](/en/concepts/internationalization) section.

### `public/` directory

Files contained within the `public/` directory are served at the root and are not modified by the build process. This is where you can locate your images, icons, and other static assets.

### `package.json`

This file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your application. The `package.json` of 
a Docus application si really minimal and looks like:

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "my-docs",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "nuxt build --extend docus",
    "dev": "nuxt dev --extend docus",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "docus": "latest",
    "better-sqlite3": "^12.2.0",
    "nuxt": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### `nuxt.config.ts`

*This file is not mandatory to start a Docus application.*

You can add extra modules to your Nuxt configuration file:

```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxtjs/plausible']
})
```

### `app.config.ts`

*This file is not mandatory to start a Docus application.*

This is where you can [configure Docus](/en/concepts/configuration) to fit your branding, handle SEO and adapt links and socials.

## Full Nuxt Project Capabilities

Since Docus v4 is a Nuxt layer, you can use **any feature** of a standard Nuxt project:

```
my-docs/
├── app/                 # App directory (optional)
│   ├── components/      # Custom Vue components
│   ├── layouts/         # Custom layouts
│   ├── pages/           # Custom Vue pages (outside of content)
│   ├── composables/     # Vue composables
│   └── middleware/      # Route middleware
├── server/              # Server-side code
│   └── api/             # API routes
├── plugins/             # Nuxt plugins
├── middleware/          # Global middleware
└── modules/             # Custom Nuxt modules
```

This layer-based approach gives you the power of the entire Nuxt ecosystem while keeping documentation as the primary focus.
