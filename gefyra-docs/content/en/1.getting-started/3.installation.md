## `create-docus` CLI

::steps
### Create your docs directory

Use the `create-docus` CLI to create a new Docus project:

```bash [Terminal]
npx create-docus my-docs
```

You can choose between two templates:
- **`default`**: Basic Docus setup for single-language documentation
- **`i18n`**: Includes internationalization support for multi-language documentation

```bash [Terminal]
# Create with i18n template
npx create-docus my-docs -t i18n
```

We recommend using the `npm` package manager.

### Start your docs server in development

Move to your docs directory and start your docs server in development mode:

```bash [Terminal]
cd my-docs
npm run dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at <http://localhost:3000>

### Write your documentation

Head over the [Edition](/en/concepts/edition) section to learn how to write your documentation.

## Layer Integration

Docus v4 uses a **Nuxt layer-based approach**, you can extend the Docus layer directly in your `nuxt.config.ts` with `extends: ['docus']`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['docus']
})
```

## Online Edition with Nuxt Studio

::prose-steps
### Create a new project on Nuxt Studio

From your user or team dashboard, click the `New project` button then choose `Start from a template` and select **Docus.** Clone it on your GitHub personal account or any organisation of your choice.

### Deploy in one click

Once your project has been created and you're in the project dashboard, navigate to the `Deploy` section, choose the `GitHub Pages` tab and set your [Nuxt UI Pro license](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing) (`NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE` ) in the environment variables then click on the **Deploy** button.

  This is a one click static deployment available with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) but you can also handle deployment yourself and use the `Selfhosted` tab.

### Write your documentation in the editor

Once the deployment is achieved, you'll be able to display the preview of your documentation. You can browse your content pages to edit them or create new ones.
