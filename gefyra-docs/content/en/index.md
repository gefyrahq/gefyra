    title: The Problem
    ---
    Building and pushing containers to test them in Kubernetes is [repetitive and time-consuming]{.font-bold}. Writing and debugging code that depends on services in Kubernetes is daunting. [Especially if they are not reachable]{.font-bold} during development.

    title: The Solution
    ---
    [Gefyra]{.font-bold} runs local code in any Kubernetes cluster [without the build and push cycle]{.font-bold}. It overlays containers in the cluster making code changes immediately available. It's a new era of software development.
