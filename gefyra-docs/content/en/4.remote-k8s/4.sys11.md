## Prerequisites

1. You have a [MetaKube](https://metakube.syseleven.de/){target="_blank"} account and privileges to create a new cluster
2. Follow the [installation](/en/quick-start/installation) of Gefyra for your preferred platform

## Setup a cluster

You may follow [this guide to create a cluster using the MetaKube management console](https://docs.syseleven.de/metakube/en/tutorials/create-a-cluster){target="_blank"}.

This guide assumes you are running an **OpenStack**-based Kubernetes cluster on SysEleven.

**Important:** Before Gefyra can connect from outside the cluster, you must set the security group of the nodes to allow UDP traffic on port 31820.

![syseleven security group settings](/img/sys11_image1.png){.w-full}

Please set the direction to _Ingress_ and the protocol to _UDP_. The port range should be set to _31820_ and the source 
CIDR to _0.0.0.0/0_. That way, Gefyra can connect to any data plane node of the cluster using a [Floating-IP](https://docs.syseleven.de/syseleven-stack/en/reference/network){target="_blank"}.

After all of the MetaKube components are ready, you can download the *kubeconfig* to access the cluster using `kubectl`. Just click on the "Download Config" button in the MetaKube management console and save the file to your local machine.

## Running Gefyra

1. You may apply some workload, for example from Gefyra's testing directory:  

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/main/testing/workloads/hello_dd.yaml
```

2. At first, we need a host IP of one of our nodes. You can get it by running: 

```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide |  awk {'print $1" " $2 " " $7'} | column -t
```

Pick one of them from the `EXTERNAL-IP` column.

3. Now you can run

```sh
gefyra up --host <IP>
```

using the IP you just picked. This will create the Gefyra components in your cluster and local host.

4. Run a local Docker image with Gefyra to make it part of the cluster.
   1. Build your Docker image with a local tag, for example from Gefyra's testing directory (in the repo):
   
   ```sh
   cd testing/images/ && docker build -f Dockerfile.local . -t pyserver
   ```

   2. Execute Gefyra's run command:

   ```sh
   gefyra run -i pyserver -N mypyserver -n default
   ```
   
   3. _Exec_ into the running container and look around. You will find the container to run within your Kubernetes cluster.  

   ```sh
   docker exec -it mypyserver bash
   ```
   
   4. Print out the website of the cluster service _hello-nginx_ from within the cluster.

   ```sh
   wget -O- hello-nginx
   ```
   
   5. Create a bridge to redirect the traffic from the cluster application to the one running locally:    
   
   ```sh
   gefyra bridge -N mypyserver -n default --ports 80:8000 --target deploy/hello-nginxdemo/hello-nginx
   ```
   
   6. List all running _bridges_:
   
   ```sh
   gefyra list --bridges
   ```
   
   7. _Unbridge_ the local container and reset the cluster to its original state: 
   
   ```sh
   gefyra unbridge --all
   ```

## Cleaning up
Remove Gefyra's components from the cluster with `gefyra down`
