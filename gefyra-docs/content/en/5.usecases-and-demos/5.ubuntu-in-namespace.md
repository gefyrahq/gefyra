Simple Usecase
::

## What you will learn

- Run a Ubuntu container as part of a Kubernetes namespace
- Install additional software to that instance
- Use this container to call Kubernetes services

## What you will need

- [Gefyra](/en/quick-start/installation)
- [Getdeck](https://github.com/Getdeck/getdeck){target="_blank"} for setting up the development infrastructure (runs on `k3d`)
- `kubectl`
- Optionally: [k3d](https://k3d.io){target="_blank"} or any other preferred Kubernetes cluster


## Creating the local development infrastructure

First, we need a Kubernetes-based development infrastructure which contains all required components. Luckily this can
be achieved quite easily with the [`Deck CLI` from here](https://github.com/Getdeck/getdeck){target="_blank"}.

Just run:

```sh
deck get https://github.com/Blueshoe/buzzword-charts.git
``` 

and you will get a fresh `k3d` cluster running locally with all required components installed. 

**Important:** These workloads are intended for demonstration purposes and are not safe for production deployments.

**Optional:** If you don't want to create the development infrastructure using `Getdeck` you can also provide it
yourself. You need:

- a Kubernetes cluster
- some workload, you can choose the example 
from [here](https://github.com/Blueshoe/buzzword-charts/tree/main/buzzword-counter){target="_blank"} and `helm install` it yourself
- a node port at 31820:31820/UDP (if running it locally)

## Getting the App Running

**Optional:** In order to observe the workload booting up, check out 
[the Kubernetes dashboard](http://dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/#/workloads?namespace=buzzword){target="_blank"} coming with this `deck`.

## Connecting Gefyra to the Kubernetes cluster

The first would be to spin up Gefyra with `gefyra up`. Please be sure to still have the development cluster 
active in your current `kubectl` context. 

**Important:** If you are running a remote Kubernetes cluster you need to specify the `--host` argument with _IP_
of one of your data plane nodes. The default port is _31820_ (`--port`), it may be different depending on firewalls and the cluster
networking.

## Running a container in a Kubernetes namespace

In this example, a Ubuntu will become part of the cluster namespace _buzzword_.
Start the container instance like so :

::code-preview
```
[INFO] Container image 'ubuntu:latest' started with name 'myubuntu' in Kubernetes namespace 'buzzword'
```

#code
```sh
gefyra run -i ubuntu -N myubuntu -n buzzword -c "bash -c 'tail -f /dev/null'"
```
::

No worries, the following explains the parameter list:
- _-i ubuntu_: run the public Docker image ob Ubuntu from here: [https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu){target="_blank"} 
- _-N myubuntu_: name this local Docker instance _myubuntu_ for further reference
- _-n buzzword_: place this Docker instance in the Kubernetes namespace _buzzword_ (where this example plays)
- _-c "bash -c 'tail -f /dev/null'"_: start this Docker instance and keep it running forever

You can check the output of `docker ps` to see your container instance running. It should look something like this:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                            NAMES

```

### Enter the container and call a service

Now that the container is running, you can enter a bash by running: `docker exec -it myubuntu bash`

```sh
root@6178770cd6b1:/#
```

In order to call an http service from this Kubernetes namespace a terminal application could be handy. The official
Ubuntu Docker image does not provide on of my favorites out of the box, but it is easy to add it.

```sh
root@6178770cd6b1:/# apt update && apt install wget -y
[...]
```

On another terminal (so not in your Ubuntu bash) you can consult `kubectl` to inspect the services in the _buzzword_ namespace. For this example it
tells:

::code-preview
```
NAME                                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                 AGE
dashboard-kubernetes-dashboard         ClusterIP   10.43.147.1     <none>        8080/TCP                                18m
[...]
buzzword-counter                       ClusterIP   10.43.221.222   <none>        9000/TCP                                18m
buzzword-counter-postgresql            ClusterIP   10.43.140.176   <none>        5432/TCP                                18m
buzzword-counter-postgresql-headless   ClusterIP   None            <none>        5432/TCP                                18m
buzzword-counter-rabbitmq              ClusterIP   10.43.0.48      <none>        4369/TCP,5672/TCP,25672/TCP,15672/TCP   18m
buzzword-counter-rabbitmq-headless     ClusterIP   None            <none>        4369/TCP,5672/TCP,25672/TCP,15672/TCP   18m
```

#code
```sh
kubectl -n buzzword get services
```
::

Let's see how this works. From within your running Ubuntu bash, you can now call the _buzzword-counter_ service on port
9000:

```sh
root@6178770cd6b1:/# wget -O- buzzword-counter:9000
--2022-04-26 13:41:43--  http://buzzword-counter:9000/

```

Et voila! The service responded to the HTTP Get request with the same answer you would get with your browser at:
[http://buzzword-counter.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080](http://buzzword-counter.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080){target="_blank"}.
You can now look around and make yourself familiar with the services
in this namespace - or even connect with the `psql` client to the _PostgreSQL_ instance running in the cluster.

### Remove the Ubuntu container

Once you are done with your work, you can remove this Ubuntu instance again with:
`docker kill myubuntu`. That's it.


## Remove the Development Infrastructure

First run `gefyra down` to uninstall Gefyra's components. If you have initially created the development infrastructure using `Getdeck` you can now run:

::code-preview
```
[INFO] Deleting the k3d cluster with name another-cluster
```

#code
```sh
deck remove --cluster https://github.com/Blueshoe/buzzword-charts.git
```
::

If you created the infrastructure yourself, you probably already know how to get rid of everything yourself ;-)

## Additional Notes

If you want maximum convenience for your developers and a supported team oriented workflow, we recommend you
