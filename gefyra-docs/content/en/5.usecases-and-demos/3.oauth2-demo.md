Advanced Usecase
::

This is more of an advanced use-case, if you just want an easy example of how Gefyra works, check out the [getting started guide](/en/local-environments/getting-started).

## What you will learn

- Create a (Python-based) backend application that reads a JWT (JSON web token)
- Get a local identity provider with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) 
- Apply the Kubernetes sidecar pattern with [OAuth2-Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) and connect the app to Keycloak
- Find and fix a bug
- Start coding locally within the Kubernetes cluster having the sidecar active

## What you will need

- [Gefyra](/en/quick-start/installation)
- [Getdeck](https://github.com/Getdeck/getdeck){target="_blank"} for setting up the development infrastructure (runs on `k3d`)
- `kubectl`
- A copy of [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos){target="_blank"}
- Optionally: [k3d](https://k3d.io){target="_blank"} or any other preferred Kubernetes cluster
- Optionally: VSCode with Python debugger installed (or any other preferred IDE)

That's about it. Let's get started.

## Creating the Development Infrastructure

First, we need a Kubernetes-based development infrastructure which contains all required components. Luckily this can
be achieved quite easily with the [`Deck CLI` from here](https://github.com/Getdeck/getdeck){target="_blank"}.

Just run: 

```sh
deck get --name oauth2-demo https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos.git
```

and you will get a fresh `k3d` cluster running locally with all required components installed. 

**Important:** These workloads are intended for demonstration purposes and are not safe for production deployments.

**Optional:** If you don't want to create the development infrastructure using `Getdeck` you can also provide it
yourself. You need:

- a Kubernetes cluster
- an identity provider (preferably Keycloak)
  - a custom realm with an oauth2 client for the backend service
  - a test user with required privileges
  - ingress config that supports a full-fledged oauth2 login flow
- the workload manifests for the backend application with the OAuth2-Proxy sidecar

## Getting the App Running

**Optional:** In order to observe the workload booting up, check out 

[the Kubernetes dashboard](http://dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/#/workloads?namespace=oauth2-demo){target="_blank"} coming with this `deck`.  
A healthy cluster looks like this:  

![Kubernetes dashboard](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_dashboard1.png){.w-full}

Once you have the workload running in Kubernetes, head over to 
[http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/){target="_blank"}.  

The following page should come up asking you to sign in with *OpenID Connect*:  

![OAuth2-Proxy login portal](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_oauth2-proxy.png){.mx-auto}

Once you click the button you will be redirected to the central login of Keycloak, which looks like this:  

![Keycloak login page](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_kc-login.png){.mx-auto}

Please notice how you got redirected to the local domain of Keycloak [http://keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/...](http://keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/){target="_blank"}.  

The demo workload contains a prepared user in Keycloak's database. You can use it to perform a login. The credentials are as
follows:  

**Username**: *john@gefyra.dev*  
**Password**: *john@gefyra.dev*  

Once you hit the *Sign In* button you will be redirected back to the beginning, but this time you will see the json output of
the backend service:

```json
{"Hello":"World"}
```

Voil√†, we have a full-fledged [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/){target="_blank"} login flow running in a Kubernetes cluster.  
So are we done yet? Not quite. Let's move on to the internals.

## The Scheme of the Infrastructure

### Kubernetes Overview

The Kubernetes cluster is running three important components for this use case:

- Keycloak: the identity provider compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- OAuth2-Proxy: a reverse proxy compatible with OpenID Connect 
- Backend Application: a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){target="_blank"} application

The OAuth2-Proxy is implemented as a sidecar and runs side-by-side in each [_Pod_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/){target="_blank"} with the backend application. If you are
not yet familiar with the sidecar pattern [please check out this resource](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-distributed-systems/9781491983638/ch02.html){target="_blank"}.
Keycloak runs in a _StatefulSet_ and is connected to a _PostgreSQL_ database.  

The Kubernetes objects of the workload are as follows:  

![Kubernetes object relation](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo-k8s1.png){.w-full}

In this picture you can find two [_Ingresses_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/){target="_blank"} 
definitions: one is serving the application [_Deployment_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/){target="_blank"} _oauth2-demo_
which schedules one _Pod_ under [oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080){target="_blank"}, the other is
serving Keycloak under [keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080](http://keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080){target="_blank"}.    

**Important:** Please mind that port _8080_ is a port mapping. From within the cluster you will see it running on port _80_.  

You can introspect the Ingress also with `kubectl`:

::code-preview
```
NAME                             CLASS    HOSTS                          ADDRESS      PORTS     AGE
keycloak                         <none>   keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io      172.23.0.2   80, 443   56m
keycloak-console                 <none>   keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io      172.23.0.2   80, 443   56m
oauth2-demo                      <none>   oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io   172.23.0.2   80        56m
dashboard-kubernetes-dashboard   <none>   dashboard.127.0.0.1.nip.io     172.23.0.2   80        56m
```

#code
```sh
kubectl --namespace oauth2-demo get ingress 
```
::

The next layer adds the Kubernetes [_Service_](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/){target="_blank"} objects which are
required to access a Pod.

You can introspect the Services also with `kubectl`:

::code-preview
```
NAME                             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                    AGE
keycloak-http                    ClusterIP   10.43.40.200    <none>        80/TCP,8443/TCP,9990/TCP   62m
keycloak-headless                ClusterIP   None            <none>        80/TCP                     62m
keycloak-postgresql              ClusterIP   10.43.231.210   <none>        5432/TCP                   62m
keycloak-postgresql-headless     ClusterIP   None            <none>        5432/TCP                   62m
oauth2-demo                      ClusterIP   10.43.160.68    <none>        8080/TCP                   62m
dashboard-kubernetes-dashboard   ClusterIP   10.43.159.219   <none>        61348/TCP                  62m
```

#code
```sh
kubectl --namespace oauth2-demo get service
```
::

Please ignore the other services as they are not important for this example.  
Finally, please also check out the Pods in the cluster's namespace with `kubectl`. It should be similar to:

::code-preview
```
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oauth2-demo-675f5c55b5-xxj57                      2/2     Running   0          63m
dashboard-kubernetes-dashboard-65dbdd8978-gd9jt   1/1     Running   0          63m
keycloak-postgresql-0                             1/1     Running   0          63m
keycloak-0                                        1/1     Running   0          63m
```

#code
```sh
kubectl --namespace oauth2-demo get pod
```
::

### The OAuth2-Demo Sidecar Workload

If you want to know more about the implementation of the sidecar pattern in this example please head over to the
[workload manifest](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos/blob/main/oauth2-demo/oauth2-demo.yaml#L37){target="_blank"}.
The important part is that the Pod template specifies two containers. The first is _name: oauth2-proxy_ and the second is
_name: oauth2-demo-app_:

```yaml
[...]
containers:
- name: oauth2-proxy
  image: quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:v7.2.1
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  [...]
  ports:
    - containerPort: 8809
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: oauth2-oauth2proxy
- name: oauth2-demo-app
  [...]
  image: "quay.io/gefyra/oauth2-demo:latest"
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ports:
    - name: http-intern
      containerPort: 8155
      protocol: TCP
[...]
```

Please have a closer look at the port configuration. The oauth2-proxy runs on port _8809_ (with name _http_) and oauth2-demo-app
runs on port _8155_. You can describe the associated service with `kubectl` to see which of both ports the traffic is pointed to:

::code-preview
```
Name:              oauth2-demo
Namespace:         oauth2-demo
Labels:            app.kubernetes.io/instance=gefyra-demos
                   app.kubernetes.io/name=oauth2-demo
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app.kubernetes.io/instance=gefyra-demos,app.kubernetes.io/name=oauth2-demo
Type:              ClusterIP
IP Families:       <none>
IP:                10.43.160.68
IPs:               10.43.160.68
Port:              http  8080/TCP
TargetPort:        http/TCP
Endpoints:         10.42.1.4:8809
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

#code
```sh
kubectl -n oauth2-demo describe service oauth2-demo
```
::

For the sidecar pattern to function, the service speaks to the target Pod on port _8809_ which is served by the oauth2-proxy.
A closer review of oauth2-proxy's configuration reveals to which address the proxy upstreams all requests:

```yaml
[...]
OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: "http://127.0.0.1:8155"
[...]
```

This is precisely the connection to the backend application **in each Pod**.  

### The OpenID Connect Flow in Brief

The following image depicts the OpenID Connect flow in brief how it is working in this example:

![The OIDC flow in brief](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo-oidc.png){.w-full}

As you can see, the OAuth2-Proxy only passes authenticated traffic to the backend application. That breaks
the application free from (potentially unsafe) custom OIDC code and authorization handling. **This is standard procedure
and should not be part of your code**. Make use of this pattern when having this requirement.  

Ok! Enough for the workload internals. Let's check out how Gefyra helps out with fixing nasty bugs.

## The Example Bug

If you hit the troublesome route [http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123){target="_blank"}
(with _123_ as an example for any int value) you will face the `Internal Server Error` message. That is a _HTTP 500_ status.
The code being executed can be found 
here: [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos/blob/main/oauth2-demo/app/main.py#L23](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos/blob/main/oauth2-demo/app/main.py#L23){target="_blank"}

```py
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def get_item(item_id: int, x_forwarded_access_token: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    if x_forwarded_access_token:
        data = jwt.decode(x_forwarded_access_token, options={"verify_signature": False})
        mail = data["Email"]
        return {"item_id": item_id, "Email": mail}
    else:
        return {"item_id": item_id, "Email": "not given"}
```

Of course, you are a very attentive reader and found the mistake immediately, but let's move on for the sake of this example.

## Gefyra to the Rescue

As always, the first would be to spin up Gefyra with
`gefyra up`. Please be sure to still have the development cluster active in your current `kubectl` context.

### Running a Development Instance of the Container

In order to inspect the application and pinpoint the bug, it requires a local instance of the container. Ideally with a
debug server running. Since you need the sidecar in place (for the OIDC logic), the development instance must be placed
in a Pod with the sidecar pattern. Gefyra offers you a unique mechanism to achieve exactly that.
Start the development instance like so (set `LOCAL_DIR` to the directory where you've copied/cloned `gefyra-demos` to):

```sh
export LOCAL_DIR=/home/<...>/gefyra-demos/oauth2-demo/app
gefyra run -i quay.io/gefyra/oauth2-demo -N myfastapi-demo \
    -n oauth2-demo -v $LOCAL_DIR:/app \
    -c "bash -c 'python -m debugpy --wait-for-client --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8155 --reload'"
```

No worries, the following explains the parameter list:
- _-i quay.io/gefyra/oauth2-demo_: run the Docker image which is also running in the cluster
- _-N myfastapi-demo_: name this local Docker instance _myfastapi-demo_ for further reference
- _-n oauth2-demo_: place this Docker instance in the Kubernetes namespace _oauth2-demo_ (where this example plays)
- _-v /home/<...>/gefyra-demos/oauth2-demo/app:/app_: mount the source code on your disk to this Docker instance at _/app_
- _-c "CMD"_: start this Docker instance with [_debugpy_](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy){target="_blank"}, the rest is like from the Kubernetes workload manifest of the application

[debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy){target="_blank"} is an implementation of the _Debug Adapter Protocol_ for Python. This protocol 
is also available for a countless number of programming languages. It basically spins up a server, in this case waiting for 
a debugger client to connect, and runs the application wrapped in with debugging capabilities.

### Attaching a Debugger to the Development Instance

Now that you are running a development instance with this Docker image locally, you need to connect the debugger client.
This example is prepared with _VSCode_ and the Python extension installed.   
In order to do that, you need to find out the local IP address Gefyra assigned to your container with:

```sh
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' myfastapi-demo
```

This will be part of the CLI soon (or maybe it already is). The command shown tells the IP of the container which is
needed for VSCode.  

Please get the code for the backend application from [the repository](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos/tree/main/oauth2-demo/app){target="_blank"} and
open up VSCode.  

Select the _Remote Attach_ option to connect to the running debugpy instance at the given IP. The port is _5678_ (please review the command above).

![starting the VSCode remote debugger](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_vscode1.png){.w-full}

In the _DEBUG CONSOLE_ it will display the following output: 

```
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/app']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8155 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [438166] using watchgod
```

Awesome. You have a debugger connected to the development instance. Now it's time to receive a request from the oauth2-proxy container.

### Bridging the Development Instance in the Cluster

In order to receive requests (i.e. traffic) from within the cluster, basically when you hit the route [http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123){target="_blank"}
in your browser, a `gefyra bridge ...` is needed.  
Just create a bridge with:

::code-preview
```
[INFO] Creating bridge for Pod oauth2-demo-675f5c55b5-xxj57
[INFO] Waiting for the bridge(s) to become active
[INFO] Bridge myfastapi established
```

#code
```sh
gefyra bridge -N myfastapi-demo -n oauth2-demo \
      --target deploy/oauth2-demo/oauth2-demo-app \
      --port 8155:8155
```
::

The parameter list specifies the following:
- _-N myfastapi-demo_: the bridge targets (on one end) the local Docker instance with the name _myfastapi-demo_
- _-n oauth2-demo_: the target workload (the other end of the bridge) is in the Kubernetes namespace _oauth2-demo_
- _-\-deployment oauth2-demo_: Gefyra intercepts all Pods of the Deployment _oauth2-demo_ (don't confuse it with the name of the namespace)
- _-\-port 8155:8155_: the bridge to map port 8155 of the container in the cluster to 8155 on the local instance
- _-\-container-name oauth2-demo-app_: since this Pod contains multiple containers (see the sidecar pattern above), Gefyra is asked to intercept the application container _oauth2-demo-app_

### Debugging the Application

Now you are ready to stop the execution of the code in your VSCode debugger.
Place the breakpoint anywhere near the position you would expect the error to happen:

![breakpoint in VSCode](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_vscode2.png){.w-full}

Point your browser to [http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123){target="_blank"} again.

Once you hit the breakpoint, you can easily look around and introspect the JWT (json web token) issued from Keycloak and 
verified with OAuth2-Proxy.

![introspecting variables and the JWT token](/img/usecases_oauth2-demo_vscode3.png){.w-full}

As you may see, the key in the token is written in a lowercase "email". This is causing the _KeyError: 'Email'_ resulting
in a 500 error.  

**Remark:** Of course you could have found this out reading the logs, but where is the fun? Anyway, debugging software is 
a tool for hunting down causes of way more complex misbehaving then in this example.

### Fixing the Bug

Since the development instance is started with your local source code mounted into the container and the _-\-reload_ flag turned on,
please move on and fix this bug. The fix looks like this:

```py
[...]
        data = jwt.decode(x_forwarded_access_token, options={"verify_signature": False})
        mail = data["email"]  # the key is with a lowercase 'email'
        return {"item_id": item_id, "Email": mail}
[...]
```

Once you have saved the changes, the application is immediately restarted with the fixed code.  
The output of the route [http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123](http://oauth2-demo.127.0.0.1.nip.io:8080/items/123){target="_blank"} is
now in the browser:

```json
{"item_id":123,"Email":"john@gefyra.dev"}
```

Awesome! Commit and push.  

This way you can be quite sure that this will work in all Kubernetes environments provisioned with these workloads.  

**Remark:** Gefyra is able to run and bridge as many applications as you need. This is useful in complex request/response
scenarios with multiple involved services - and potentially all with a debugger attached. Isn't that neat?

### Shutting Down Gefyra

In order to clean everything up, you can run `gefyra down`. This will remove the running bridges and shut down the development
container instances. You will now find the cluster reset to the state with the original bug around. For the fix to become persistent
you will need to roll out a new version of the container image specified in the Kubernetes workload manifest.

## Remove the Development Infrastructure

If you have initially created the development infrastructure using `Getdeck` you can now run:

::code-preview
```
[INFO] Deleting the k3d cluster with name gefyra-demos
```
#code
```sh
deck remove --cluster https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra-demos.git
```
::

If you created the infrastructure yourself, you probably already know how to get rid of everything yourself ;-)
