# Gefyra Docker Desktop Extension

[Gefyra's Docker Desktop Extension](https://hub.docker.com/r/gefyra/docker-desktop-extension){target="_blank"} allows you to run containers on your local machine and connect them to Kubernetes-based resources. It is a great way to test a new service in the cluster or write code that depends on Kubernetes resources.

::note
Gefyra's Docker Desktop Extension still runs Gefyra v1 internally and thus does not support shared environments.

**Looking for CLI rather than a GUI?** Check out [Gefyra's CLI](/en/quick-start/installation/)

## Installation

The Gefyra Docker Desktop Extension is available on the Docker Desktop extension [marketplace](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/gefyra/docker-desktop-extension){target="_blank"}. 

However, you can also install it by running the following command:

```shell
docker extension install gefyra/docker-desktop-extension:latest
```

## Usage

After installing the extension it becomes available in the Docker Desktop Extension sidebar. Gefyra Docker Desktop currently only supports the `run` mode. After clicking on the `run` tile you're guided through the process of running a container on your local machine.

Firstly Gefyra needs to know about your cluster to allow you to set all settings accordingly.

After choosing your *kubeconfig* and context you can then proceed to adding the settings for your container. In case you have a remote cluster
you need to provide Gefyra with its connection parameters under `Remote Cluster Settings`.

![Docker Desktop Extension Container Settings](/img/extension/container_light.png)

There are several settings for the container - most importantly the `image`, `namespace` and `command` settings.
The `image` setting is the image that will be used to run the container - Gefyra will you show any image that is available in the local Docker Desktop context as 
well as images that are available in the chosen Kubernetes namespace. The `namespace` setting is the namespace in which the container will be available.
Gefyra allows you to copy the environment variables of a certain workload through the `Copy Environment From` dropdown.
You can add volumes and more variables through the `Add Volume` and `Add Environment Variable` buttons.
As soon as you're done hit run!

Gefyra ensures that its cluster components are in the correct state and starts the container.

Once the container is running Gefyra will show you the logs of the container.
